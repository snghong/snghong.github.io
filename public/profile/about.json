    "about":  "Hi! I'm Hong. Welcome to my website! \n\n I'm passionate about understanding our world from a broad perspective, which translates to interests in large-scale systems, history, sociology, literature, languages, writing and cooking. \n\n I grew up in Singapore learning about the humanities and music, studied computer science and logic at college (where this photo is from) and currently work in Seattle. \n\n I'm a member of the Unicode Consortium, Singapore's Infantry reserve and the Strangers United soccer club. \n\n",
